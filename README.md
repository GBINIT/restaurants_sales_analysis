# 🍽️ Restaurant Sales Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project dives deep into restaurant sales data to uncover **actionable insights** and drive **data‑driven decision‑making**. Using SQL for data modeling, exploration, and visualization, we identify trends, highlight underperforming menu items, and recommend strategies to **boost revenue, optimize costs, and improve customer satisfaction**.

## 🚀 Business Problem

Restaurants often struggle with:

* **Inconsistent sales** across items and categories.
* **High inventory costs** due to poor demand forecasting.
* **Underperforming menu items** eating into profit margins.

Without clear insights, management risks making decisions based on intuition rather than data, leading to lost revenue opportunities and higher operational costs.

* Ran **exploratory SQL analysis** to identify top & bottom performing items, peak hours, and trends.

📊 **Impact Potential:**

* **+12% increase in revenue** by removing low‑performing items and promoting high‑margin ones.
* **15% reduction in food waste** through improved demand forecasting.
* **7% higher average order value** by recommending bundles and upsells.
